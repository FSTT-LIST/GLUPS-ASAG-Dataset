This dataset is designed to train and test authomatic short answer grading (ASAG) in Arabic.

We have collected our dataset manually from school children aged between 11 to 12 years old. We have used Google forms to collect the answers.  All the participants were studying in the sixth grade of primary education in different groups in Morocco. Those schoolchildren have answered 18 questions related to the Islamic education course. A human instructor has evaluated and graded all answers. The grades were between 0 and 2: 0 for completely incorrect, 1 for partially correct, 2 for correct.
 

Schoolchildren have answered these questions at home on a computer or on mobile. We have noticed that 75% of the answers have 8 words or less. Compared to other datasets collected in university or from adult responses, the answers that we have collected have fewer words. We looked also to the data from the score perspective to insure that all scores were present. We found out that it is important to insure that all scores are present in the dataset to help machine learning algorithms work correctly.
